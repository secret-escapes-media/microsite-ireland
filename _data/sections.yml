  description: >
    <p class="text--xxl text--medium">Dublin is a sprawling hub of energy, creativity and old&#8209;school cool.</p>
    <p class="text--xl">Across the Ha'penny Bridge, the streets buzz with excitement. Trad folk music echoes from a lengthy (and equally legendary) procession of pubs, cosy, inviting, and filled with smiling faces; Dubliners are an affable bunch, who relish chatting to visitors. Amongst pretty Georgian townhouses, riverside walks, grand revivalist college buildings and cobbled streets, there’s a character to the city – one you can get to know in well under two hours from all British airports. Between hearty Irish eats and indie street-food hangouts, a stout and singalong or cocktail with a view, Dublin’s repertoire is a diverse one; should you feel you need more, one of the city’s true beauties is its proximity to gorgeous outdoor destinations. Nestled between mountains and sea, a half-hour train can whisk you to beautiful seaside towns before returning to the electric draw of this spirited city.</p>

        title: Literary Pub Crawl
        description-html: >
          <p>It’s one thing embarking on a pub crawl in Dublin; quite another to do so under the proviso of checking-in at the city’s literary haunts. Sharing a whiskey with Joyce, Yeats, Wilde – well, the whole affair is now simply far more sophisticated. The Brazen Head, Dublin’s oldest pub and filled with centuries of radical history, was supposedly Jonathan Swift’s favourite haunt; his irreverent satire probably made for excellent pub chat. Next, in the footsteps of Joyce’s Ulysses protagonist Leopold Bloom, off to Davy Byrne’s. Joyce drank here, with the place full on Bloomsday – gorgonzola sarnies and burgundy all round. Neary’s was a second home to poet and playwright Brendan Behan in the 50s, alongside modernist novelist Flann O’Brien. The latter could also be caught in Oliver St John Gogarty, drinking with fellow poet Patrick Kavanagh. Naturally, both would also frequent Palace Bar, alongside Brendan Behan and others. A last tipple before a tipsy walk to bed; Toner’s beckons. Yeats was no fan of pubs, but Toner’s was clearly to his liking as he often stopped by for a sherry; Bram Stoker of Dracula fame was also a stalwart regular. The dark wood interior and heavy stone floor makes Toner’s an irresistible boozer for a swift pint.</p>

        title: Old Dublin
        description: Dublin is brimming with stories that stretch back centuries. Start at the grand Georgian hulk of Trinity College and make for the Old Library. The Long Room is a breathtaking architectural ode to learning, a vast, cavernous space that holds, in towering shelves, the oldest of the library’s treasures. Here, you’ll catch a fleeting glimpse at the 9th-century Book of Kells, one of the most important medieval manuscripts in the world. For a further glance into Ireland’s past, don’t miss the National Museum; specifically the Archaeology Museum. Magnificent gold hordes and Viking relics await, but stretching back even further are some remarkably macabre bog bodies; dating from the Iron Age, their incredibly preserved remains whisper stories of kingship and feuds from millenia ago. If you like that kind of gruesome thing, do not miss the crypt at St. Michan’s Church. Here, mummies spill from their rotting coffins. Meet the 800-year-old crusader ready to shake your hand, the man with no hands, and the nun. Bram Stoker visited as a child and, well, the connection is pretty plain. Morbid fascinations aside, the rest of Dublin continues to share its past. From the famous Guinness Brewery to the story of Irish independence at the Kilmainham Gaol, don’t miss your view into Dublin’s past.

        description: The city’s dining scene is thriving. Even traditional Irish dishes have enjoyed a renaissance of late; creative chefs are reinventing the flavours of the land with contemporary flourishes, at lauded restaurants like The Pig’s Ear, Forest & Marcy and more. Just like the city itself, the food scene is equally diverse; around Camden Street you’ll find a cheaper selection of foodie hotspots, from hot Asian cool at Neon (with self-pour whippy machine to finish) and eclectic (bargain) dishes at Green 19, to middle-eastern favourites and brunch spots galore. If that hasn’t stumped your appetite, don’t miss an afternoon of perusing the Temple Bar Food Market.

        description: One thing that never fails to impress is how well-rounded a trip to Dublin can be. Hopping on the local DART trains can whisk you off to the most beautiful coastal destinations, a stone’s throw from the city’s bustling centre. Head along the coast and find treasures at Blackrock Market, or make for the beach at Killiney, with gorgeous views from the train to boot. Dalkey is nearby, a wonderfully charming spot that remains a favourite of a-list celebs and savvy travellers. Howth is equally as pretty, with a fishing heritage that translates to the dining table, plus irresistible walking trails to while away the afternoons. And that’s just the start; the coastline and mountains around Dublin are fantastic for exploring, with most train journeys just over a half hour.

A city of characters, its quarters each take on different personalities; the red-brick and cobbles of the Cathedral Quarter, the post-industrial, cultural revival of the Titanic Quarter and the drinks and dining scene of the trendy Linen Quarter – the list goes on. Yet its walkable size and friendly demeanour belies its urban spread; almost like a village, Belfast is good craic as well as multifaceted. It’s also wonderfully affordable, there’s no need for euros, and itineraries can easily be filled with exquisite restaurants, a host of galleries and museums (obviously not missing the Titanic Experience Belfast), buzzing music scene and much, much more.

Artisan coffee hangouts rub shoulder to shoulder with homely pubs, a truly exquisite dining scene complements the famed English Market. History pokes its head around most street corners, from ancient churches to vast forts, with cultural treasures hiding in a network of galleries and DIY art spaces. Cork is more than just a set of things to see and do; it's a spirit, an atmosphere, a Friday night in the Mutton Lane Inn and good craic with enthusiastic locals.

Its old centre, centred around the Medieval Mile, is all cobbled streets and secret passageways, a warren of cosy pubs and a crafts and arts scene battling with ancient churches and castles for your attention. The imposing Norman castle and its beautiful gardens are a good place to start, before exploring the mile – where trad folk buzzes from pubs and alleys hide quaint craft shops – and finishing at St Canice’s. This old cathedral shares whispers of witchcraft, decades of history and historically poignant graves. The tower is a must climb – the experience is unique, the inside incredibly narrow and the summit vertigo-inducing. But the views across the pretty river and medieval heart of Kilkenny are unmissable.

          <p>The wild northern coast is possibly one of the most romantic sections of the Wild Atlantic Way. Malin Head offers rare glimpses at the Northern Lights, stone-age forts and pretty harbours, before Fanad Head exposes gorgeous beaches, romantic castles and herds of seals. Further south the cliffs punch higher, forming some of the best and highest in Europe. The Slieve League Cliffs afford incredible Atlantic views, with the Sligo Mountains looming behind. Mullaghmore Head is renowned for its big wave surfing, but beyond the beach sports you can explore 6th century Monastic ruins, gothic castles and the much mythologised Ben Bulben mountain. Dramatic cliffs fall to turbulent waves, with clifftop hiking trails taking in the wild beauty of the edge of Ireland. Even more drama awaits at the Cliffs of Moher, where the trails tower above the crashing sea.</p>
          <p>From gargantuan geology to lunar landscapes at Burren, on to Loop Head, which promises some truly gorgeous coastal roads. Follow the sound of crashing waves and head to the tip of the peninsula, where the old lighthouse and surrounding waters give the impression you’ve reached the end of Ireland. In the Southern Peninsulas, the ethereal remains of Skellig Michael are one of Ireland’s most prized archaeological sites. The 6th century ruins cling to fierce rocky outcrops, painting a truly captivating scene. Before you reach the craggy beauty of Mizen Head, don’t miss Ireland’s only cable car at Dursey Island; this is your chance to soar above the crashing waves. It’s also the only way to get to the island, populated by just three farming families. It doesn’t get as remote as that.</p>

        description: A coastline this dramatic is, typically, a playground for those with a penchant for adventure. Sheer cliffs and windswept beaches, turbulent waves and intrepid trails – it’s all there, waiting for a brave soul to explore. One of the best ways to get that adrenaline fix with minimum experience is by coasteering on Clare Island. It’s a wonderfully physical way to explore the cliffs, a mixture of climbing, diving and wild swimming. Clamber up sea stacks, jump from their heady heights, navigate tricky cliff faces and discover enchanting sea caves. For those with a little more expertise, the climbing around Dunshean Head near Dingle is truly exhilarating. The most striking sea stack, aptly named the Needle, features one particularly challenging, vertiginous climb. With the roaring sea underneath, it’s a uniquely Atlantic experience. Beyond these cliffside challenges, you can take life at a steadier pace. Seak kayaking is popular along much of the coastline, and on dry land trails provide ample challenge for a spot of mountain biking – the lunar Burren being the finer example. Choose your adventure on the Wild Atlantic Way.

          <p>There’s a wealth of uniquely Irish culture to tap into as you glide along this wild coastline; eccentric, revelrous and hospitable. A good place to start is the hub of any community: the local pub. In these cosy spots you can try and unpick the nuances of Irish trad. In Donegal, listen out for the simple acapella melodies of sean nós and the historic fiddle traditions of the town. In Sligo, you’ll hear more flute and a pace married more to following dancers. Spoil the senses in Galway, where music booms from bars and buskers, and the art scene is positively buzzing. As you head further south still too, you’ll notice the fiddle sounds change, become more elongated and soft. Pick up these subtleties and you’ll be a trad expert in no time!</p>
          <p>Beyond music, the Wild Atlantic Way has also inspired its fair share of artists and writers – most famously, the poetry of Yeats. Sligo is home to the landscapes that inspired him most at a young age – pick up a collection of his poetry before you set off on your hike.</p>

        description: Discover the stories of Ireland’s east. Stretching back thousands of years, you can hear whispers of Vikings in Waterford, or gaze at the gothic turrets of Tipperary’s romantic Rock of Cashel. Ireland’s spiritual side is no better illustrated than at a collection of ancient monastic sites; the ruins of 6th century Clonmacnoise stand testament to the Golden Age of learning, with renowned manuscripts heralding from this remote monastic town. Arguably more impressive is Glendalough, which spills across a wooded hillside striking a rather ethereal tone. This great 6th-century monastic settlement is one of Ireland’s most important. Travel even further back in time – 5,000 years to be exact – and discover the stone-age passage tomb at Newgrange. This monolithic burial mound hides some remarkable curios; its astrological alignment is significant, but the best trick is during the winter solstice, when the dark passageway is set alight by the low-slung sun. Road-trip routes criss-cross this part of Ireland; from castles to coastline, there’s a wealth of stories to discover.

Between Derry~Londonderry and Belfast, embark on a road trip that takes in the best of Northern Ireland’s wild outdoors – what’s more, there’s no need to change your currency, and as an added bonus, you’re going to find wonderfully reasonable prices all-round. First up, The Gobbins Cliff Path. Suspended walkways see you trek next to the cliff face, offering glimpses at smugglers’ caves and quiet coves. Further along the coast, the romantic ruins of Dunluce Castle perch precariously on the headland. So precarious in fact, that the place was abandoned after part of the kitchen fell into the sea – ambitious to say the least. For a taste of proper Irish whiskey, stop off at the Old Bushmills Distillery, the country’s oldest working distillery. With your head a little lighter from that dram, the perfect opportunity to tackle the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge presents itself. Slung between two crags, it’s a heady endeavour; but unmissable, nonetheless. And now for the routes namesake: the Giant’s Causeway. A Northern Irish icon, the hexagonal steps are a sight to behold. Filled with myths and legends, it’s the perfect finish to an adventure along Northern Ireland’s beguiling coastline."
